## Hi, I'm Juanita 😊
I'm 22 year old recent graduate (2023) in Politics anad International Studies from the Univeristy of Warwick. Despite my degree, I have always been intrigued by technology and its endless possibilities hence why I decided it was time to start my coding journey! I'm so grateful for this CFGDegree opportunity as I will continue to learn, grow and meet more like-minded people!

# 📝 Assignment Notes and Explanations

<br>

I already had a GitHub account made, so I was quite familiar with the use of repositories remotely. Above you can find my README.md which details some facts about me using different markdown formatting syntax!

Now I will use screenshots to evidence and explain the process of completing this assignment.
